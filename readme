this is a website  tha enables one to upload files from the computer and save them .
Here we create a tiny website hosted for free on GitHub Pages, and use Formspree to collect the uploads.

Formspree lets you send form submissions (like uploaded images) to your email without needing your own server.
action="https://formspree.io/f/xnndnvnb" 
form id is generated from formspree


2. Set up Formspree
Go to formspree.io.

Click Get Started â†’ New Project â†’ Form.

Copy the Form ID they give you (something like f/abcde123).

3. Upload your site to GitHub
Create a free account on GitHub.

Create a new repository called photo-upload.

Upload your index.html file.

Go to Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Choose your branch (main) and root (/).

GitHub will give you a link like:
https://yourusername.github.io/photo-upload/

Now you have a real upload page you can share! ðŸŽ‰
